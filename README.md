# Crimson Menu
 Crimson Menu is a lightweight, custom Roblox menu project designed for experimentation, learning, and personal use. Development is ongoing, and updates will continue to roll out over time. You can always access the most recent version  in the #source-code channel.

# Safety & File Information
 Crimson Menu is 100% safe.
 It is not an executable file and contains no malware, “rats,” or harmful components. The project is written entirely in Lua, which means you will need a compatible Roblox executor to run it.

# Source Code Notice
The menu is still in an early development stage and is not intended for heavy modification. Editing the source code may cause features to break or behave unpredictably. For the best experience, avoid altering internal systems unless you fully understand the structure.

#Template Usage
You are welcome to use the template as a foundation for creating your own Roblox menu.
This permission does not include rebranding or redistributing Crimson Menu itself as your own project.
